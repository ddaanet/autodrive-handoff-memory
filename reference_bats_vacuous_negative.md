description: "In bats, `run missing_function` exits 127, so a negative `[ $status -ne 0 ]` assertion passes before the code exists — negative-only tests cannot fail for the right reason during RED"

A bats assertion of the shape

```bash
run some_predicate <<< "input"
[ "$status" -ne 0 ]     # expecting "false"
```

passes when `some_predicate` **does not exist**: `run` captures the 127
"command not found" status, which satisfies `-ne 0`. Observed 2026-07-20 while
TDD-ing `is_unknown_command` — two of three predicate tests went green during
the RED phase, before a line of implementation was written.

**Why it matters:** it defeats the point of watching the test fail. A negative
assertion proves nothing about a function that isn't there yet, so a predicate
covered *only* by false-cases has no RED phase at all — and would stay green if
the function were later deleted or renamed.

**How to apply:** every predicate needs at least one **positive** assertion
(`[ "$status" -eq 0 ]`) — that is the one that actually pins existence and
behavior. Treat negative cases as refinements around it, not as coverage on
their own. Same trap applies to any `run`-based check keyed on non-zero exit,
including `run !` forms.

bug — a bare `! cmd` mid-body does not fail a bats test at all),
