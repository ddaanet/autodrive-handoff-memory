Verified 2026-07-19 against Claude Code v2.1.215 (Opus 4.8, tmux 3.5a) by
driving a throwaway `claude` session in a detached tmux session with a logging
hook on every event. Supersedes the 2026-07-18 v2.1.214 pass, whose
"input during busy is queued and runs as its own turn afterward" was too
coarse — it holds only for slash commands, not prose.

**Mid-turn input has four distinct classes** (not one "queued" behavior):

| typed mid-turn | behavior | UserPromptSubmit |
|---|---|---|
| `/focus` (TUI-local) | intercepted immediately, never queued | — |
| `/compact` (harness action) | queued → interpreted at turn boundary | no |
| `/handoff` (plugin/skill) | queued → drains as its own turn | **yes** |
| plain prose | **injected into the running turn's next call** | no |

- **Slash input never reaches the model as prose.** Unrecognized commands drain
  to `● Unknown command: …`. No hallucination path.
- **Prose is the dangerous input** — it contaminates the running turn.
- **Queued input does NOT bypass hooks in general.** `/compact` skips
  UserPromptSubmit because it never becomes a prompt; a queued plugin command
  fires it with the raw command text as `prompt`.
- **Hook chain:** `Stop` → `PreCompact` (+0.75s) → `SessionStart` with
  `"source":"compact"` (+47s). Queue drains ~0.75s after `Stop`.
- **`Stop` does NOT fire on Esc interrupt** — interrupted turns fail safe.
  Payload carries `last_assistant_message`, `stop_hook_active`, `prompt_id`,
  `effort`, `background_tasks`, `session_crons`.
- **Command recognition is visible before Enter**: typing `/compact` with no
  Enter renders an autocomplete row + description; `/comzzz` renders
  `No commands match "/comzzz"`. Makes type-verify-submit implementable.
- **Busy = the `[0-9]+s ·` timer** + randomized gerund. `_rename-lib.sh`'s
  `is_busy` transfers unchanged, BUT read only the **visible** pane —
  `capture-pane -S` history matches a stale timer and reports busy long after
  `Stop`.
- **An Enter sent immediately after a long `send-keys -l` is absorbed as a line
  break, not a submit** — it lands inside the TUI's paste window. Observed
  2026-07-20: `/compact` (line 1) submitted because its command-recognition
  readback happened to sit between the text and the Enter; the continuation
  prose (line 2, ~190 chars, no readback) did not, and needed a manual Enter.
  **Always put a settle delay between the literal send and the first Enter.**
- **Never confirm a submit by reading the pane at all** — not "the composer
  looks empty" (an absorbed Enter leaves a multi-line composer that reads as
  empty) and not `is_busy` either, which was the 2026-07-20 answer and is
  wrong: a queued submit is accepted and transcript-logged at once but shows
  no spinner until its turn starts, and a 103-second compaction showed none
  either. Confirm against something the harness owns — a file the transition's
  own `SessionStart` consumes, or a new entry in the session transcript.
- **Readiness ≠ the `❯` glyph** (still true): the glyph shows while the backend
  is `/rc connecting…`.
- **A freshly exec'd `claude` process shows no busy indicator while it
  boots.** An idle-poll gate that reads only busy-absence treats the boot
  window as already-idle; the composer (`❯`) itself does not exist yet
  either, so a keystroke sent then lands nowhere (3.9s for a bare launch,
  2026-08-15). The glyph's presence is not the gate, though: under
  `--resume` a `❯` is on screen at once (stale frame, replayed transcript),
  so gate on cursor-in-composer. The loss window is earlier — between the
  alt-screen switch and the first paint, where typed characters echo onto
  the raw screen and never arrive (`aoeuidhtnsaoe` typed across a boot left
  `aoeunsaoe`). From the composer on, input is **buffered, not lost**:
  the composer paints nothing for 3–9s more, load-dependent, then shows every
  keystroke sent meanwhile (20 of 20 probe markers, 2026-09-21). A landing
  check must outlast that delay; a delay before sending buys nothing, and an
  empty composer seconds after a send is not evidence of a dropped keystroke.
- **tmux socket is unreachable from the agent's sandboxed Bash**
  (`Operation not permitted`) — hook-spawned watchers are the only
  sandbox-clean path; spike driving needs `dangerouslyDisableSandbox`.
- **`claude --plugin-dir <path>`** (repeatable) loads a dev plugin tree into a
  throwaway session — the way to exercise a working-copy plugin in a scratch
  project without touching global enablement. Note the command registers
  unnamespaced (`/handoff`, not `/handoff:handoff`).

## `/compact` is double-recorded in the transcript — one submission, two entries

A report that "`/compact` was posted twice" is Claude Code's own bookkeeping, not
a driver defect. Every `/compact` — manual ones included, verified in sessions
predating any automation — logs a RAW prompt entry **plus** a `<command-name>`
record about 30ms apart, and both render. One submission, double-recorded.

This matters to anything that counts submissions in a transcript to confirm a
keystroke landed: the count is inflated by one per slash command, so key such a
check on a structural signal rather than on "how many entries appeared".

Sibling gotcha for interactive overlays: `tmux display-popup` is invisible under
iTerm2's `-CC` control mode — use `tmux new-window` instead.
