When you cut a capability, cut all of it in the same pass. Do not leave
behind: tests that assert the *absence* of the removed behavior ("test
that it's not what it used to be"), fixtures or sentinel data that stood
for the removed inputs, or a now-trivial script preserved as its own
file/subprocess. A module collapsed to a few lines should be inlined
into its single caller, not kept as a hollow shell.

**Why:** half-removals force the reader to reconstruct what's live vs.
vestigial, and absence-guards grow stale defending behavior nobody will
re-add — pure noise. If a design "proved harmful," the cleanup is total,
not a museum of guards against its return.

**How to apply:** after removing a feature, grep for its whole machinery
— helpers, constants, fixtures, tests, docs, recipes — and cut each;
convert any absence-guard into the positive contract of what remains.
Shares the spirit of [[feedback_no_compat_aliases]] (no compat shims)
and [[feedback_design_supersede_no_museum]] (the docs analogue).
